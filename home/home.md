### We have three demands

1. Tell The Truth
    - Government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.
1. Act Now
    - Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.
1. Beyond Politics
    - Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizensâ€™ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.
