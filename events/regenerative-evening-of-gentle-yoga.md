A regenerative evening of gentle yoga with Megan.   
Everyone is welcome and you don't need to have any previous experience of yoga.  
If the weather is fine then we'll hold the session outside in the lovely garden.   
Please bring a mat or a towel.  
There will most definitely be time for a cuppa and a chat too!  
Hope to see you there ðŸ˜Š  
Love from,  
the Exeter Regen Team x
